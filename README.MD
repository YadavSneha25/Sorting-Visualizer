# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

I developed this web application to provide an interactive way to visualize classic sorting algorithms. This project was an excellent opportunity for me to enhance my skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** while creating a useful educational tool for beginner programmers to better understand how sorting algorithms work through visual representation.

## Purpose

I created this sorting algorithm visualizer to:

- Improve my proficiency in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
- Provide beginner programmers with an intuitive way to learn and understand sorting algorithms through visual demonstrations.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms

This application includes visualizations for the following sorting algorithms:

1. **Bubble Sort**
2. **Insertion Sort**
3. **Selection Sort**
4. **Merge Sort**
5. **Quick Sort**

These algorithms are presented in an easy-to-use interface that allows users to see step-by-step how data is manipulated and sorted.

## About Me

I am **Sneha Yadav**, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science (Class of 2026) at Graphic Era Deemed to be University, Uttarakhand. Working on this project has not only deepened my understanding of sorting algorithms but has also strengthened my web development skills, preparing me for more complex programming challenges in the future.
